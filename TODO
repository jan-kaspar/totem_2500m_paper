* add reference (nemes-2015) to paper by Tamas (in some place of the text where we discuss the combination of total cross-section and rho)


* uncertainties of magenta models
 - evaluate uncertainty bands for magenta models, evaluate correlations of Delta si_tot vs Delta rho
 - add protective statement to the paper


* Fig 11: same binning as in Tab 3, alternatively indicate which binning used in Fig. 11


* Tab 3: add "other uncertainties"


* Tab 3: when calculating absolute uncertainties: which "y value" to use -- bin content or fit ??
