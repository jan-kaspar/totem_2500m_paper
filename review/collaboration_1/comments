Title: complete by adding as last word exchange, after “three-gluon bound…”
Line 9: Why do we cite PDG edition of 2010? Shouldn’t we cite the most recent? 2016 has CITATION: C. Patrignani et al. (Particle Data Group), Chin. Phys. C, 40, 100001 (2016) and 2017 update.
Editorial comment: citation should be numbered following the order with which they appear in the article.
Line 19: citation 4 and 9 should be moved after the part of the sentence they specifically refer to.  We refer to many features and we should find a quote for each one of them.
Line 28 these models are associated to the concept… in the 70’ by Nicolescu[7] and later confirmed…. By Lipatov[10] , as well as etc.   may be move citation [27] to the end of the sentence.
**Line 34 to 46: the argument here is a bit confused (hard to follow).  The idea of “where is best to look for the Odderon” is extensively and nicely explained in lines 527-542.  Either we move that paragraph here (still quite general) or we drop some of this 
A possible way:    Line 46: “at low energies the amplitudes for this additional channels are dominated by those of the Pomeron(s) exchange ﬁrst, and by the Pomeron-photon exchange then, which explains the reasons why their effect has been difﬁcult to be detected experimentally.   The best experimental situation to detect these effects that are easily masked by larger ones in pp elastic scattering is to look at regions in which the Pomeron contribution is small (like in the region of the dip of the cross section) or at very small angles where it appears in the interference term when the nuclear and the coulomb cross section become equal.   This is the main reason for which the 2.5 km optics was designed.

Line 36 space after energy,   and then “is” instead of was complicated
Line 52: the theoretical models which are not excluded by this measurement require signiﬁcantly lower ρ  (the sentence bites itself…( non-excluded and consistent are almost… synonyms)
Line 55: “besides” instead of “in addition to”
Line 90: add a “the” before magnification and Dispersion and the same , add “the” before  vertex and momentum.
Line 96: I would rearrange as “… with a new, special optics, the β ∗ = 2500m, speciﬁcally developed for measuring low-|t| elastic scattering and conventionally labelled by the value of the β -function at the interaction point.”  (puts more emphasis that it was designed for this measurement… but it is also simply a style matter, though motivated).
Line 151: should we explain here in clear what the meaning of the “asterisks”? It is the first moment we “use” angles.
Line 135: either add a “of the” before elastic (or remove it before optics)
Line 164: two offline methods: (colon) first etc.  otherwise next sentence has no “verb”. Then instead of  the “dash” in line 165 put a “full stop” and continue with: The alignment procedure is repeated… 
Line 185 has no verb:   we want to say that “ The resolution… IS used for The selection…THE   etc.”
Line 195 “especially AT the”
Line 200  These par >>> The parameters were tuned “with” 
Table 2: separator line overlaps with superscripts
Line 210 the left and THE right arm
Line 212 The thresholds for the cuts
Line 213 add a “distributed” almost uniformly
Line 218 add THE before vertical.
Line 219  is better compared to…. >>> is better if compared with 
Line 220>>>  cut 1 in the 4RP analysis is more efficient(useful to remind we are back to the 4RP case)
Line 240 estimated to BE
Line 245: Since >>> Beisdes
Line 246 remove comma after therefore
Line 251: I would put the formula (9) before and explain it after… : The correction for phase-space limitations can be written as …(9)
Line 267: However biases can arise indirectly from
Line 280: “… their edge and possibly secondary particles from showers have more chance to be detected. (I would not use the term “induced” for the additional particle track)
Line 282 “…, the presence of a second particle track…
Line 287 are discarded as such  since a shower, remove "as such"
Line 288 “elastic proton interacting with detectors.” >>>  “elastic proton measured in the detectors”
Line 289:  “The value for T_2” (I would try not to use “outcome”)
Line 311 : Figure 9 shows the case for two of those  (or at the beginning of the sentence say simply “two parametrisations”)
Line 315 >>> setting the integrated “( or eventually “requiring AN integrated”.)
Line 317: instead of “components” I would say “two parts” or “two steps”
Line 320 :  uncertainty FROM [6].
Line 323: “twice as large” … (or if you prefer “two times larger”)
Line 326 THE data
Line 328:” values are listed in Table 3
Figure 10 caption: (the ﬁt shown or reproduced in Figure 13)… replace “featuring” with “of”
Line 345: do you want to say “the uncertainties of the fitted slope or the uncertainties on the intercept from the fit?
Line 347 (to keep the same style of the list) “ The beam-momentum uncertainty needs to be considered when” >>> The beam-momentum uncertainty: considered when…”
Line 350: why a dash between fit and model? … or better “model dependence of the fit”
Line 358 from all THE analysed…
Line 361: per-effect… I would just expand it …the correlations..respected for each systematic uncertainty.
figure 11: caption: use “due to systematic uncertainties.”   Then “ The colour in the plot …” 
line 365”include THE vertical… and THE uncertainty  of  THE…”
Line 368 are listed in tabke 3 and are used to approximate.  (why do you say” can be used” is it just a possibility?)
Line 374: “before and then after” or “after then before”?  I am for following the time sequence since this wants to show a possible evolution. (in case modify caption of fig 12 too)
Line 377 due to THE vertical…
Line 379 AN excellent agreement between this analysis and previous…
Table 3 caption : why don’t we add” leading systematic biases and their sign”? Editorial: the table top line overlaps with the caption, as do other horizontal lines. To fit it better in the page one might use slightly smaller fonts.
Line 382 considering the effects 
Line 396 In that region…  “fixed to a form”? approximated by a function?”
Line 417: I would put a % to both 5.5
Line 418 remove the “comma”
Line 419 which is THEN added (and remove at the end)
Line 424: add is about before systematic and before normalization.
Line 426: the fits have negligible… add THE in front each item of this list (not onle for the first and the last)
Line 431:data, constraining them by a maximal value of |t| >>> data for two different value of |t_max|.  The value of … 0.15    corresponds   The value of 0.7 (remove some of the too many commas)
Line 439: good quality rho values in the small range…
Line 440: the two limiting values in Table.
Line 441 :To obtain the second value we used the largest… in the fit, and corresponds to the best rho determination.  In this case the fit…
Line 448: is interesting also for another reason.
Line 449: the one available in the UA4 >>> to the one used by UA4/2  (use UA4/2 everywhere)
Line 452: had the acceptance stopped
Line 455: configuration results very similar to the ones obtained with the “SWY”…
Line 456: In that sense, >>> from this point of view this 
Line 458: yields the ρ value incompatible  >>>  yields a rho value incompatible at the level of about 4.8σ with…
Line 460: Another set of tests was performed in order   >>> Further tests were performed to probe     
Line 462: otimise rho with all THE data keeping the hadronic modulus fixed to the value obtained from the first step.
Line 469: For the minimum weight possible ﬁts where the higher-|t| data are not used at all have already been discussed previously for the case with |t_max| =0.07 
Line 472: from Ref. [6]. The latter assumes” >>> from Ref. [6] which assumes
Line 478:correction to the value of σ_el published in
Line 480: For our best ﬁt (combination N   >>> Our best fit (combination with N…) yields   mb, value compatible even if slightly higher with our publication Ref [6].
Line 481: This order is expected  (remove order)
Line 487 existing data.   Extrapolations from these COMPETE models are confronted with the new TOTEM measurements in figure 17, which shows they are grouped in 3 bands.
Line 500: remove well 
Line 506: replace “the ensemble of” with “both TOTEM measurements of s_tot and rho discussed in this paper.”
Line 508: Another, even less model-dependent, relation between σ_tot and ρ can be obtained from dispersion relations …. >>> Dispersion relation provide another less model-dependent relation between σ_tot and ρ
Line 509 and following: If only crossing-even component of the amplitude is considered, it can be shown that ρ is proportional to the rate of growth of σtot with energy. >>> Considering only crossing-even component of the scattering amplitude shows that ρ is proportional to the rate of growth of σ_tot with energy that show a sustained growth of σtot with a low value of ρ.
This contradiction may be solved if also odd-signature objects can be exchanged by protons.
Line 513: may naturally come >> might have naturally come from secondary Reggeons, their contribution is generally …
Line 519 : crossing-even (remove final T) trajectories were also studied with the framework of  Regge Theory as a counterpart of the crossing-even Pomeron.
Line 522 with THE other particle
Line 524 Editorial: put no space between last word of sentence and a full stop.
Line 528: (move immediately after sentence ending in line 531) “there are 3 regions argued to be sensitive.” >>> 3 regions may be particularly favoured (or sensitive)  for the study of this component.”
Line 530  exchanges (plural to match those)
Line 534 described by >>> described as 
Line 535: tend to be   >>>   are  (want to add a quote to ISR and SppS publications?) either here or in the detailed discussion of following sentences.
Line 540: Besides since the contribution from 2-gluon exchanges is rapidly dropping the high |t| region may also be sensitive to 3-gluon exchanges [ref  Landshoff?] 
Line 542: [reference?] for my culture: which is the yet another pertutbative QCD?
Line 543: Figure 18 shows two models that are compatible with the TOTEM data   >>> Figure 18 compares the TOTEM data with two compatible models, Nicolescu[ ] and the Durham …
Line 544: a crossing (not AN)
Line 545: the existing data and the models.    The effect of the Nicolescu model is negligible at √s ≈ 500GeV but its size grows with energy making it very signiﬁcant at 13TeV.
Line 548: the Nicolescu model which shows a stronger energy…
Line 549: make it more affirmative: a new line for the last sentence:  (remove in turn) and say  “for example a precise rho measurement …
Line 553: >>> Given the low-|t|

Line 561: For each of the two models f >>> for both models found to be …

REFERENCES:
I think we should add the title of each paper.
We should quote ATLAS in the list of measurements performed at the LHC…  the plot in the range 8 to 13 TeV  does already do sufficient justice.
