(Fredrik Oljemark:) my comments on rho paper v5:

All references to figures & equations:
-> in Figure labels, are called "Fig.NN", while all references to figures are "in Figure NN"
-> consistent

-> but all equations are labeled "(N)", and refered to as "c.f. / in / e.g. Eq.(N)"
-> maybe spell out "in equation (N)" to be consistent with figure references?
-> or invert the placement of Fig.N vs Figure N in labels & references?


Fig.2 : The red graph shows a rate of high-
-> the rate

Fig.3 :
-> y-axis isn't labeled (Numbers per bin, like in Fig.5)

Fig.4: Theta in labels differs quite a bit from theta in the text, font-wise, and theta not named as variable in figure label text.

Fig.10: the black cross markers look a little too thick in the inset, maybe use a smaller linewidth, comparable to the thinnest green band visible, at 0.0056?

Fig.11, right subplot: maybe the black envelope line could be a little thinner too, so you can separate the widening line at very small t from the y-axis, at least around the blow-up starting at t=-0.002.


Fig.16: why do we cite PDG (2010), when the latest PDG link (http://pdg.lbl.gov/2017/citation.html) says:
"Please use this citation:
C. Patrignani et al. (Particle Data Group), Chin. Phys. C, 40, 100001 (2016) and 2017 update. "
Is this figure from the first papers of 2011? Unmodified?

Fig.19: without Odderon
-> the/an Odderon
including Odderon
-> the/an
an 0.8mb effect
->a(n) 0. = a zero point / an oh point / a naught point [zero/naught=BritENG?]




L9: a large variety of phenomenological models in the last decades
-> "the last" decades seems to imply one or two -> were there truly not quite a lot of models already in the 80's and before?

L11: above mentioned
-> above-mentioned

L23: oscillatory behaviour, the growth
-> oscillatory behaviour, and the growth (last item in list)

L30: would have naturally
-> would naturally have 

L34: and by the Pomeron-photon exchange then
-> -photon exchange next

L34: which explains the reasons why their effect has been difficult to be detected
-> which explains why
-> has been difficult to detect

L52: consistently with the \rho measurement
-> consistent with

L57: having their ratio converging to 1
-> converge to 1

L57: rather than their difference converging to 0
-> ok, converging || having

L59: the first experimental evidence for the total cross-section saturation effects at higher energies,
-> evidence for total cross-section saturation effects

L60: eventually deviating from the asymptotic-like behaviour.
-> the asymptotic-like behaviour seen in previous data/measurements.

L70: symmetric with respect to the IP,
-> [symmetric with respect to sign(z), but only T2 has some kind of circular symmetry around the beam, so maybe better to say]
-> symmetrically on both sides of the IP,

L75: A RP
-> An RP

L286: inability of a RP
-> an RP

L296: Proton interactions in a RP
-> an RP

L85: micrometers
-> [we use millimetres on L76, change this to British ENG too?]
-> micrometres

L135: triggered by double-arm proton trigger
-> by a double-arm

L136: or zero-bias trigger
-> or a zero-bias trigger

L138: than 7 millions of elastic event candidates
-> than 7 million elastic event candidates

L152: , they are only merged
-> , and are only merged

L176: is repeated in 20 minutes time intervals
-> in 20-minute time intervals

L182: 0.013 and 3.9 x 10^-4
-> [special x 1E-4 at end of line, maybe possible to misunderstand as applying to both terms? 
-> [Maybe change x -> *]


L192: we quote the theta-bias in x,y L&R, and the correlation x vs y, but we only quote the final systematic error, not the size of these biases on Theta_elastic (avg L+R) or t (quadratic sum x+y)
-> [no, wait, we do decompose the systematic error on t in Table 3]

L198: used for unsmearing correction
-> the unsmearing correction


L210: a MC study
-> an MC

(Left- & ) Rightmost vs right-most:
Table 2 (-), L384 (-), Table 3 (- and no-), L504 (no-)

L248: order-of-magnitue
-> magnitude

L294: prevents from using
-> prevents [us] using

L296: 
-> an RP


L296: another RP downstream represent another source
-> represent a second source

L320: where the rapid cross-section growth occurs
-> where rapid cross-section growth occurs


L322: , however yielding negligible
-> , yielding only negligible
-> , yielding, however,  negligible



L345-L364: maybe make this into a table, or a numbered list, or add a colon at the end of L344
-> considered:

Table 4: the top 5 systematics shown in Tables 3&4, how were they ranked, and do the top 5 differ for |t|<0.052 & >0.052? If so maybe it might make sense to to show
different top 5 contributions in each table. [although that would halve the range over which the reader can extract numerical covariance matrix estimates]

L418: similar to the past analyses.
-> to past analyses.

Eq (18) & L430: the font of the V (=covariance matrix) looks a little weird




L494: Monte-Carlo studies
-> Monte Carlo studies

L499: 256 models were been considered
-> had been considered
-> were considered

L500: Out of these models
-> Of these models

L501: have been found
-> had been found?

L502: they are grouped 3 bands.
-> grouped in 3

L528: due to their Regge trajectory intercept lower than unity
-> being lower than unity

L535: These 3 gluons are bound together more strongly than their interaction with other particles is.
-> [interactions aren't bound; or is this a colourless triplet -> QCD interaction strength falls off faster than for coloured partons / finite range?]
-> These 3 gluons are bound together more strongly than any possible interaction with other particles [is this true?]

L537: Such a state – on one hand – can 
-> Such a state can, on the one hand, 

L541: There are multiple ways how a...component may manifest itself in ... data.
-> There are multiple ways a(n)...component may

L542: , there are 3 regions argued to be sensitive.
-> [no arguments cited, ->]
-> , 3 regions are especially sensitive

L554: D0 observation of very shallow dip
-> a very shallow
-> [do we call the collaboration D0 in text, or use the ornate font with a slash through the O/0?]


L556: Sometimes high |t| region
-> the high-|t| region

L560: [41] and the
-> [41], and 


L562: to reach the agreement between the data and model
-> reach agreement

L572: similarly to the previous observation
-> like the previous

L575: The fit over maximum of data points
-> over a maximum (number) of data points

L581: was essential for reaching the good agreement
-> was essential in reaching good agreement

L582: If it will be demonstrated
-> is later demonstrated

L594: references:
-> add clickable (DOI) links
Journal abbreviations:
sometimes Europhys.Lett. [with no space between words], other times:]  Eur. Phys. J. C76 [spaces after periods]
-> spaces look better, add them to refs [2,3,9,]
