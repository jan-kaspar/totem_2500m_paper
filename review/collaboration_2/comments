so I recommend to quote this work also in line 38.
In particular, Fig. 1 of the above paper indicates that at ISR there were three three different energies,
where pp and ppbar data are published at the same energy, the trouble was the low statistics and
also the strong contributions from Reggeon exchange, as discussed later also in line 551.

Similarly, in the end of the paper, in line 556, I recommend to include this reference as


Sometimes high |t| region is also argued to be sensitive 
-->
Sometimes the |t\ dependence both at intermediate~\cite{Ster:2015esa} 
and at high |t| region is also argued to be sensitive ...

see in particular Fig 5 of the above paper, where the t dependence of the Pomeron and Odderon
contribution is explicitely demonstrated (perhaos for the first time?)
from fits with the Philips-Barger model to earlier data.

I am trying to send more detailed comments but perhaps these are the really important observations.
Please kindly consider them when finalizing the rho - odderon paper.
Frici presented these results at the Zimanyi Winter School 
basically repeating the TOTEM talk at the last LHCC, and these results are 
received with great interest, so I suggest to consider referring to the above results, that move away from the t= 0 point
for the  Odderon's contribution to dsigma/dt.

* first to remove the mentioning of the Odderon when discussing the predictions of the Durham model both in the legend and figure caption. Use instead 3-gluon exchange or something equivalent.

* second to add a comment in the text saying that the reason why the Nicolescu 2007 overestimate the sigma_tot at LHC is likely connected with the ambiguities in prolonging the amplitudes in the non-forward region referring to Nicolescu 2017. This is what he states in the 2017 paper in the introduction so we can refer to it.
 
Another change would be to remove the mentioning of the oddball (page 1 and 23) and only stick to the vector glueball, which is accepted terminology for the J^PC = 1^-- glueball. If one goes through literature, oddball seem
mostly to be used for a glueball with J^PC state not allowed for qqbar for example O^-- but not 1^-- that is a perfectly valid J^PC state also for a qqbar.
 
Depending whether there is feedback from PH that requires changes in the paper, I would suggest you make them at the same time. Otherwise we might postpone them to after the feedback from the journal.
