* unfolding

Due to feedback from Eckhard Elsen on the PH preprint of the 2.5 km paper regarding the unfolding
(paragraph 5.2.5), I think it would be appropriate to add a few lines to the text to avoid similar feedback
during the journal submission (or afterwards). These are essentially things that were explicitly written in
the 1 km paper but are missing in the 2.5 km paper.  
 
-        Add “Due to the very small beam divergence” (or something similar) before “The correction for
resolution effects is determined …” (now motivation for the chosen method  missing in paper)
-        At the end of the paragraph, explicitly state the remaining uncertainty estimate after unfolding
correction independently how small it is (now only description of how the estimate is made in
paper but not the numerical estimate itself)

  - add also a protective statement on the dip

* page 21: use differences, round to 2 digits, use \approx sign

* where we write that si_tot growth slows down - write wrt. what, add reference to the Froissart bound

* add reference to Tamas's paper?
