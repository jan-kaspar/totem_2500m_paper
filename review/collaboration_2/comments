Fig. 19:

* first to remove the mentioning of the Odderon when discussing the predictions of the Durham model both in the legend and figure caption. Use instead 3-gluon exchange or something equivalent.

* second to add a comment in the text saying that the reason why the Nicolescu 2007 overestimate the sigma_tot at LHC is likely connected with the ambiguities in prolonging the amplitudes in the non-forward region referring to Nicolescu 2017. This is what he states in the 2017 paper in the introduction so we can refer to it.
 
Another change would be to remove the mentioning of the oddball (page 1 and 23) and only stick to the vector glueball, which is accepted terminology for the J^PC = 1^-- glueball. If one goes through literature, oddball seem
mostly to be used for a glueball with J^PC state not allowed for qqbar for example O^-- but not 1^-- that is a perfectly valid J^PC state also for a qqbar.
 
Depending whether there is feedback from PH that requires changes in the paper, I would suggest you make them at the same time. Otherwise we might postpone them to after the feedback from the journal.
