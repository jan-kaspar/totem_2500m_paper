\> differential cross-section
\>> purely exponential behaviour at low $|t|$ excluded

\> rh
\>> best fit
\>> fit for most fair comparison
\>> all other fits give rho in between the two case above
\>> one of the most precise rho measurements ever ?

\> $\sigma_{\rm tot}$
\>> for the best fit

\> COMPETE: incompatible with si\_tot + rh

\> Odderon: one of the few possibilities to reconcile models with data

\> Odderon (and other names): object predicted/studied in many frameworks

\> models compatible with our data
\>> inclusion of Odderon makes the models match better with the data
\>> point out differences? Durham model much flatter, ...

\> outlook
\>> 900 GeV run can be valuable
\>>> rho can distinguish between the model of Nicolescu and Durham
\>>> energy not far from 546, this dip comparison would be indicative (if we can measure the dip!)
\>> dip differences at the same energy - easier interpretation at high energy, no secondary reggeons
\>>> possible at LHC?
