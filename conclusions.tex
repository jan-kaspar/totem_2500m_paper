\> differential cross-section
\>> purely exponential behaviour at low $|t|$ excluded

\> rh
\>> best fit
\>> fit for most fair comparison
\>> all other fits give rho in between the two case above
\>> one of the most precise rho measurements ever ?

\> $\sigma_{\rm tot}$
\>> for the best fit

\> COMPETE: incompatible with si\_tot + rh

\> Odderon: one of the few posibilities to reconcile models with data



\> outlook
\>> 900 GeV run can be valuable
\>>> rho can distinguish between the model of Nicolescu and Durham
\>>> energy not far from 546, this dip comparison would be indicative (if we can measure the dip!)
