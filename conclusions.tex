\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

The measurement of elastic differential cross-section disfavours the purely-exponential low-$|t|$ behaviour at $\sqrt s = 13\un{TeV}$, similarly to the previous observation at $8\un{TeV}$. Thanks to the very low-$|t|$ reach, the first extraction of the $\rho$ parameter at $\sqrt s = 13\un{TeV}$ was made by exploiting the Coulomb-nuclear interference. The fit with conditions similar to past experiments yields $\rho = 0.09 \pm 0.01$, one of the most precise $\rho$ determinations in history. The fit over the maximum of data points and with maximum reasonable flexibility of the fit function gives $\rho = 0.10 \pm 0.01$.

The updated collection of TOTEM's $\sigma_{\rm tot}$ and $\rho$ data presents a stringent test of model descriptions. For an indicative example, none of the models considered by the COMPETE collaboration is compatible with both $\sigma_{\rm tot}$ and $\rho$.

For both models found to be consistent with TOTEM's data, the inclusion of a 3-gluon-state exchange in the $t$-channel was essential for reaching the good agreement with the data.

If it is demonstrated in future that the crossing-odd exchange component is unimportant for elastic scattering, the low $\rho$ value determined in this publication represents the first experimental evidence for slowing down of the total cross-section growth at higher energies, leading to a deviation from most current model expectations.
