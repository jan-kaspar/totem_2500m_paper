\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

The measurement of elastic differential cross-section allows to disfavour the purely-exponential low-$|t|$ behaviour at $\sqrt s = 13\un{TeV}$, similarly to the previous observation at $8\un{TeV}$. Thanks to the very low-$|t|$ reach, the first extraction of the $\rho$ parameter at $\sqrt s = 13\un{TeV}$ was made exploiting the Coulomb-nuclear interference. The fit with conditions similar to past experiments yields $\rho = 0.088 \pm 0.010$, one of the most precise $\rho$ determinations in history. The fit with maximum of data points included and with maximum reasonable flexibility of the fit function gives $\rho = 0.102 \pm 0.012$ and $\sigma_{\rm tot} = (112.1 \pm 3.0)\un{mb}$.

The updated collection of TOTEM's $\sigma_{\rm tot}$ and $\rho$ data presents a stringent test to model descriptions. For an indicative example, none of the models considered by the COMPETE collaboration is compatible both with $\sigma_{\rm tot}$ and $\rho$.

For each of the two models found to be consistent with TOTEM's data, the inclusion of a crossing-odd component leads to an improved agreement with the data.
