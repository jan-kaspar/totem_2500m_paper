The TOTEM experiment at the CERN LHC has measured elastic proton-proton 
scattering at the centre-of-mass energy 
$\sqrt{s}=8\,$TeV and four-momentum transfers
squared, $|t|$, from $6\times10^{-4}\,\rm GeV^{2}$ to 0.2\,GeV$^{2}$.
Near the lower end of the $t$-interval the differential cross-section is 
sensitive to the 
interference between the hadronic and the electromagnetic scattering amplitudes.
This article presents the elastic cross-section measurement and the constraints it 
imposes on the functional forms of the modulus and
phase of the hadronic elastic amplitude. The data exclude the traditional 
Simplified West and Yennie interference formula that requires a constant 
phase and a purely exponential modulus of the hadronic amplitude. 
For parametrisations of the hadronic modulus with second- or third-order 
polynomials in the exponent, the data are compatible with hadronic phase 
functions giving either central or peripheral behaviour in the impact 
parameter picture of elastic scattering. In both cases, 
the $\rho$-parameter is found to be $0.12 \pm 0.03$. 
The results for the total hadronic 
cross-section are $\sigma_{\rm tot} = (102.9 \pm 2.3)$\,mb and 
$(103.0 \pm 2.3)$\,mb for central and peripheral phase formulations, 
respectively. Both are consistent with previous TOTEM measurements.
