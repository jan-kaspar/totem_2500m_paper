The TOTEM experiment at the LHC has performed the first measurement at $\sqrt s = 13\un{TeV}$ of the $\rho$ parameter, the real to imaginary ratio of the nuclear elastic scattering amplitude at $t=0$, obtaining the following results: $\rho = 0.088 \pm 0.010$ and $\rho = 0.102 \pm 0.012$, depending on different physics assumptions and mathematical modelling. The unprecedented precision of the $\rho$ measurement, combined with the TOTEM total cross-section measurements in an energy range larger than $10\un{TeV}$ (from $2.76$ to $13\un{TeV}$), has implied the exclusion of all the models classified and published by COMPETE. The $\rho$ results obtained by TOTEM are compatible with the predictions, from alternative theoretical models both in the Regge-like framework and in the modern QCD framework, of a colourless 3-gluon bound state exchange in the $t$-channel of the proton-proton elastic scattering.
